# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > | Git is an open source tool that stores code. It allows multiple developers to simultaneously work on the same project without conflicting versions. |

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > | It allows you to create a new folder(s)/directory.  |

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > | A pseudo class is a keyword that you would add to a selector that is specific to a state of an element. Eg. :hover - When a button is hovered over it can change colors etc...  |

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > | If there are two conflicting CSS rules, the more specific rule is applied. |

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > | If you write an !important rule the only way to override it is with another !important rule. I think debuging could become very hard and confusing. |

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > | Selector "h1", Property "color:", value "rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);" |

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > | Good design influences people by appeal, accessibility, and user friendliness.    |

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > | Wireframing allows you to plan and visualize the structure of the page you're creating. It also allows you to stylize and create the smaller details before having to write any html code. |

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > | I think it's worthwhile because it helps guide you while you are writing your code. Essentially you're copying you're artistic creation into code. |

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > | Allows elements to be sized and and arranged relative to one another. |

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > | Padding, Borders, Margins, & the content within it. |
